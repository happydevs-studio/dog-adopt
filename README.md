# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Authentication & Database)

## Authentication Setup

This application uses Supabase for authentication.

### Local Development Setup

**Step 1: Sign Up**
1. Navigate to `/auth` in your browser
2. Sign up with any email/password (e.g., `admin@test.com` / `admin123`)

**Step 2: Make Yourself Admin**

Run the helper script:
```bash
./scripts/make-admin.sh admin@test.com
```

Or manually via SQL:
```bash
docker exec supabase_db_dog-adopt psql -U postgres -c "UPDATE dogadopt.user_roles SET role = 'admin' WHERE user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@test.com');"
```

**Step 3: Access Admin Panel**
- Refresh your browser
- You'll see an "Admin" link in the header
- Navigate to `/admin` to manage dogs

### Google OAuth (Mock for Local Dev)

When you click "Continue with Google" locally, it creates a mock Google user automatically.
To promote a mock Google user to admin, find their email and run the make-admin script.

### Production Setup

For production deployment:
1. Set up Supabase authentication providers in your Supabase dashboard
2. Configure OAuth providers (Google, etc.) as needed
3. Create admin users by running the SQL command to update their role to 'admin'

## How can I deploy this project?

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)

This project uses GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD:

1. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when code is pushed to the `main` branch
2. **Supabase Migrations**: Automatically applies database migrations when migration files are updated
3. **Code Complexity Check**: Automatically analyzes code complexity on PRs and pushes to main
4. **Unused Code Check**: Automatically detects unused files, dependencies, and exports using [knip](https://knip.dev/)

**Setup Instructions:**
See [CI/CD Setup Documentation](docs/CI_CD_SETUP.md) for detailed configuration steps.
See [Complexity Check Documentation](docs/COMPLEXITY_CHECK.md) for code quality guidelines.
See [Knip Analysis](docs/KNIP_ANALYSIS.md) for unused code detection results.

**Quick Setup:**
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (set source to "GitHub Actions")
2. Add required secrets in repository settings:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`
   - `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF`
3. Push to `main` branch to trigger deployment

## Code Quality Tools

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **ESLint**: Code linting (`npm run lint`)
- **TypeScript**: Type checking (`npm run typecheck`)
- **Knip**: Unused code detection (`npm run knip`)
- **Playwright**: Smoke testing (`npm run test:smoke`)

### Finding Unused Code

This project uses [knip](https://knip.dev/) to find unused files, dependencies, and exports:

```bash
# Check for all unused code
npm run knip

# Check only production dependencies
npm run knip:production
```

Knip runs automatically in CI and will comment on PRs with findings. See [docs/KNIP_ANALYSIS.md](docs/KNIP_ANALYSIS.md) for the latest analysis results.

## Data Management

### Rescues and Locations

This project maintains a reference list of quality rescue organizations committed to high animal welfare standards. The data is managed through the seed file which uses MERGE logic to keep the database synchronized.

**Updating Rescues Data:**

1. Edit the seed file: `supabase/seed.sql` (search for "RESCUES AND LOCATIONS REFERENCE DATA")
2. Test locally: `npm run supabase:reset` (resets DB and runs seed file)
3. Deploy: Push to main branch (auto-runs seed via GitHub Actions)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ MERGE statement handles inserts, updates, AND deletes
- ✅ Only updates records when data has changed
- ✅ Maintains full audit trail of all changes
- ✅ Automatically runs with migrations via `--include-seed` flag
- ✅ Creates default locations for new rescues
- ✅ Safe to run multiple times (idempotent)

The seed file uses SQL MERGE to synchronize the database with the reference data, including removing rescues that are no longer in the seed file.

### Alternative Deployment

You can also deploy via [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/REPLACE_WITH_PROJECT_ID) by clicking Share -> Publish.
