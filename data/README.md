# Data Collection Artifacts

This directory contains data files generated by various data collection scripts.

## Rescue Contact Data

Files generated by the Charity Commission API contact collector:

- `rescue-contacts.csv` - Contact details collected from Charity Commission API
- `rescue-contacts-fixed.csv` - Corrected/verified contact details
- `new-rescue-contacts.csv` - New rescue contacts added in specific collection runs
- `missing-rescue-contacts.csv` - Rescues that need contact data collection

See [../docs/RESCUE_CONTACT_COLLECTION.md](../docs/RESCUE_CONTACT_COLLECTION.md) for documentation.

## Geocoding Data

Files generated by the postcodes.io geocoding script:

- `rescue-coordinates.csv` - Latitude/longitude coordinates for UK rescues
- `rescue-coordinates.sql` - SQL statements to update coordinates in database

See geocoding section in [../docs/RESCUE_CONTACT_COLLECTION.md](../docs/RESCUE_CONTACT_COLLECTION.md).

## Usage

These files are reference data from completed collection runs. They show:
- What data was collected
- Which rescues were processed
- Results of collection attempts

**Important:** The authoritative data is in the Supabase database (via `supabase/seed.sql`). These CSV/SQL files are historical artifacts showing collection results.

## Regenerating Data

To regenerate these files:

### Contact Collection
```bash
npm run collect-contacts
```

### Geocoding
```bash
node scripts/geocode-rescues.js
```

## Notes

- CSV files are kept in version control to show collection history
- New data collection runs may create additional files
- Files in root directory with pattern `*.csv` or `*.sql` are gitignored
- This data/ directory specifically tracks committed collection artifacts
